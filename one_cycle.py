    """
    In paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09820.pdf), author suggests to do one cycle during 
    whole run with 2 steps of equal length. During first step, increase the learning rate 
    from lower learning rate to higher learning rate. And in second step, decrease it from 
    higher to lower learning rate. This is Cyclic learning rate policy. Author suggests one 
    addition to this. - During last few hundred/thousand iterations of cycle reduce the 
    learning rate to 1/100th or 1/1000th of the lower learning rate.
    Also, Author suggests that reducing momentum when learning rate is increasing. So, we make 
    one cycle of momentum also with learning rate - Decrease momentum when learning rate is 
    increasing and increase momentum when learning rate is decreasing.
    Args:
        nb              Total number of iterations including all epochs
        max_lr          The optimum learning rate. This learning rate will be used as highest 
                        learning rate. The learning rate will fluctuate between max_lr to
                        max_lr/div and then (max_lr/div)/div.
        momentum_vals   The maximum and minimum momentum values between which momentum will
                        fluctuate during cycle.
                        Default values are (0.95, 0.85)
        prcnt           The percentage of cycle length for which we annihilate learning rate
                        way below the lower learnig rate.
                        The default value is 10
        div             The division factor used to get lower boundary of learning rate. This
                        will be used with max_lr value to decide lower learning rate boundary.
                        This value is also used to decide how much we annihilate the learning 
                        rate below lower learning rate.
                        The default value is 10.
